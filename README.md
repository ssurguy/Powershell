# Introduction 
This repository is meant to store the scripts I have been working on to improve automation at my company. These scripts have been edited to showcase the work while removing any specific company references. However, the concepts introduced in the scripts can be applied to other organizations, and stand to show my development in PowerShell,

# Getting Started
These scripts are dependent on an O365 enterprise environment. Intune/EndpointManager, Azure Active Directory, Exchange, and on-prem AD are necessary for running these.
